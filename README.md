## ML-classification

### [Product Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/william-gray/data-science-python/blob/master/ML-classification/Analyzing%20Product%20Sentiment.ipynb)
Classification model that predicts a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information, etc.)

## ML-clustering

### [Related Article Clustering](https://github.com/william-gray/data-science-python/blob/master/ML-clustering/Related%20Article%20Clustering/Wikipedia_Related_Article_Clustering.ipynb)
Analyzes text data to estimate related articles using a nearest neighbor model.

## ML-recommenderSystem

### [Song Recommender](https://github.com/william-gray/data-science-python/blob/master/ML-recommenderSystem/Song%20Recommender.ipynb)
Matrix factorization model that recommends songs based on data features. Performance is measured using a precision recall curve.

## ML-regression

### [Predicting House Prices](https://github.com/william-gray/data-science-python/blob/master/ML-regression/PredictingHousePrices.ipynb)
Linear regression model that predicts a continuous value (house price) from input features (square footage, # of bedrooms and bathrooms, etc.)

## ML-deepLearning

### [Image Classification](https://github.com/william-gray/data-science-python/blob/master/ML-deepLearning/Image%20Classification%20with%20Deep%20Features.ipynb)
Uses deep learning features to predict image contents.

### [Image Retrieval](https://github.com/william-gray/data-science-python/blob/master/ML-deepLearning/NearestNeighborImageRetrieval.ipynb)
Uses deep learning features and a nearest neighbor model to retrieve similar images.
